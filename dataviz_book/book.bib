   abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

year = {2014},
isbn = {1461471370},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.}

    abstract = {Author Summary A long-standing challenge in biology is to unravel the chain of molecular events linking genetic variation to phenotypes like disease. Identifying the genes that act as intermediates between the underlying genetic variation and the disease can offer new ways to intervene in its progression. While large-scale molecular profiles are an important starting point, it is difficult to distinguish causal relationships from correlative associations. In this study, our goal was to develop strategies to identify these causal intermediates. We studied the effects of genetic differences in baker's yeast on fitness in multiple environmental conditions. While genetic effects on fitness depended strongly on the environment, genetic effects on the expression of truly causal intermediate genes tended to persist despite environmental changes. This indicates that causal intermediates can be found among genes whose expression is affected by genetic variation independently of environment. We thus developed a statistical method to predict causal intermediates based on genetics, gene expression, and fitness in multiple environments. Our study has implications for the design and analysis of clinical molecular profiling efforts towards understanding how genetic variation causes disease, suggesting that multiple contexts (e.g., cell types) can be informative even if they are not afflicted by the disease.},
